    "# 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "i) Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of the object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface for interacting with that state. This helps in protecting the integrity of the object's data.\n",
    "ii) Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It allows programmers to work at a higher level of complexity by focusing on the interactions at a higher level and not worrying about the internal workings.\n",
    "iii) Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. Subclasses can extend or override methods from their superclasses.\n",
    "iv) Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is commonly achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) and method overloading (methods with the same name but different parameters). Polymorphism enables flexibility and the ability to use a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "v) Composition: Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes. This allows complex behaviors to be constructed by combining simpler objects, promoting modularity and code reuse. Unlike inheritance, which represents an \"is-a\" relationship, composition represents a \"has-a\" relationship between classes.\n",
    ">> These concepts work together to create a structured and manageable approach to programming, making it easier to design, maintain, and extend software systems.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# 2. Write a Python class for a `Car` with attributes for `make`, `model`, and `year`. Include a method to display the car's information.\n",

    "#3. Explain the difference between instance methods and class methods. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "'''\n",
    ">. In Python, instance methods and class methods are both types of methods that you can define within a class, but they serve different purposes and have different ways of being called.\n",
    "i) Instance Methods\n",
    ">> Instance methods operate on an instance of the class (an object) and can access and modify the instance's attributes. They take self as their first parameter, which refers to the instance calling the method.\n",

    "\n",
    "# ii) Class Methods\n",
    "# Class methods operate on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They take cls as their first parameter, which refers to the class itself. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator. They can be called on the class itself or on an instance of the class.\n",

    "* Key Differences\n",
    "** Instance Methods: Operate on an instance and can access or modify instance attributes. Called using the instance of the class.\n",
    "** Class Methods: Operate on the class itself and can access or modify class-level attributes. Called using the class itself or an instance of the class.\n",
    ">> Both types of methods can be useful depending on whether you need to work with instance-specific data or class-level data.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# 4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.\n",
    "'''\n",
    ">> Python does not support method overloading in the same way as some other languages like Java or C++. In languages with traditional method overloading, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. However, in Python, a method in a class can only have one definition.\n",
    ">. That said, Python achieves a similar effect through the use of default arguments, variable-length argument lists, and keyword arguments. This allows a single method to handle a range of input scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Python's Approach to Method Overloading\n",
    "* You can use default parameters or *args and **kwargs to simulate method overloading:\n",

    "            total += num\n",

    "# Adding more than two numbers\n",
    "print(math_op.add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default Arguments Example\n",
    "# You can also use default arguments to achieve overloading-like behavior:\n",
